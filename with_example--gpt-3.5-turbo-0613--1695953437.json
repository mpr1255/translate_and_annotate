The author, claiming to have experienced a dream, conceals the true events and uses supernatural elements to tell the story of 'A Dream of Red Mansions'. Therefore, the protagonist is named 'Jia Baoyu'. But what events and characters are recorded in the book? The author reflects on his own lack of achievement and compares himself to the exceptional women he once knew. Feeling inferior, he regrets his past and decides to write a book to confess his shortcomings to the world. Although he acknowledges his own faults, he believes that the stories of the women in the inner chambers should not be forgotten because of his own shortcomings. The humble setting of his life does not hinder his creativity, and he finds inspiration in the beauty of nature. Despite his lack of formal education, he uses vernacular language to convey his thoughts and hopes to enlighten and entertain readers. The use of words like 'dream' and 'illusion' throughout the text serves as a reminder to the readers[@ft1].\", \"annotations\": [{\"id\": \"@ft1\", \"text\": \"'A Dream of Red Mansions' is a classic Chinese novel written by Cao Xueqin in the 18th century.
