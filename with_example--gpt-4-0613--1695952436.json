The author himself says: After experiencing a series of dreams, he hides the truth and uses spiritual communication to write this book, 'The Story of the Stone'[@ft1], hence the name 'Zhen Shi Yin'[@ft2]. But what events and people does the book record? He also says: 'Now I am idle and have accomplished nothing. I suddenly think of all the women I have known. After careful consideration, I realize that their actions and insights are all superior to mine. I, a man, am truly inferior to them, the women. I am filled with shame, but regret is of no use, it is a day of utter despair. On this day, I want to confess to the world that I have relied on the grace of heaven and the virtue of my ancestors, enjoyed luxury and abundance, betrayed the kindness of my father and brothers, and the virtue of my teachers and friends, resulting in my current state of having no skills and a life of failure. I compile this collection to confess my many sins. However, there are many people in the boudoir who should not be obliterated because of my unworthiness. Therefore, my humble dwelling and simple bed do not hinder my aspirations. Moreover, the morning wind and evening moon, the willows on the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, all inspire my writing. Although I am uneducated, why can't I use colloquial language to express it? It can also make the boudoir known. It can also break the monotony of the moment and awaken the eyes of others, isn't it appropriate?' Hence the name 'Jia Yucun'[@ft3]. Furthermore, the use of words like 'dream' and 'illusion' in the text is the main theme of this book, and also serves to remind the reader.\", \"annotations\": [{\"id\": \"@ft1\", \"text\": \"'The Story of the Stone' is another name for 'Dream of the Red Chamber', one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.\"}, {\"id\": \"@ft2\", \"text\": \"'Zhen Shi Yin' translates to 'the hidden truth in reality', a pseudonym used by the author to suggest the allegorical nature of the novel.\"}, {\"id\": \"@ft3\", \"text\": \"'Jia Yucun' is a character in the novel who represents the author's self-reflection and confession.\"}]}"
