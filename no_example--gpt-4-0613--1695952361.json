The author states: After experiencing a series of dreams and illusions, I have chosen to conceal the truth and instead, use a spiritual medium to narrate this book, 'The Story of the Stone'. Hence, it is called 'Zhen Shiyin' and so on. But what events and people does the book record? I also say: 'Now, in the hustle and bustle of life, I have accomplished nothing. Suddenly, I think of all the women I have known: after careful consideration, I realize that their actions and insights are superior to mine. I, a grown man, am not as good as they are. I am filled with shame, but regret is of no use, it is a day of utter helplessness. On this day, I want to confess to the world that I have relied on the grace of heaven and the virtue of my ancestors, enjoyed the days of luxury and abundance, betrayed the kindness of my father and brothers, and the moral teachings of my teachers and friends, resulting in my current state of incompetence and half a life of failure. I have written this collection to confess to the world. I know that my sins are many, but there are many people in the boudoir who should not be obliterated because of my unworthiness. Therefore, the humble dwelling and the simple bed, the rope bed and the tile stove, do not hinder my aspirations; moreover, the morning wind and the evening moon, the courtyard willows and flowers, even more inspire my writing. Although I am uneducated and illiterate, why can't I use colloquial language to narrate? It can also make the boudoir known. It can also break the monotony of the moment and awaken the eyes of others, isn't it appropriate?' Hence, it is called 'Jia Yucun' and so on. Furthermore, the use of words like 'dream' and 'illusion' in the text is the main theme of this book, and also serves to remind the reader.\",\n  \"annotations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft1\",\n      \"text\": \"'Zhen Shiyin' and 'Jia Yucun' are pseudonyms used by the author in the novel 'The Story of the Stone', also known as 'Dream of the Red Chamber'.
