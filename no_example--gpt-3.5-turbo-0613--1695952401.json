The author himself said: After experiencing a dreamlike state, he concealed the true events and used the concept of spiritual communication to write this book, hence the name 'Jia Baoyu'. But what events and people are recorded in the book? The author also said: 'Nowadays, I am living an ordinary life without any achievements. Suddenly, I think of the women I had in the past: I carefully consider each one and realize that their behavior and knowledge surpass mine. I, a man, am truly inferior to those women. I am ashamed and regretful, but it is of no use. I have reached a point where there is nothing I can do. On this day, I want to express my gratitude to the blessings and virtues of heaven and ancestors, the days of wearing luxurious clothes and eating delicious food, and the days of betraying the kindness of my father and brothers and the teachings of my teachers and friends. I want to write a book to tell the world. I know that I have committed many sins, but there are many outstanding women in the inner chambers. I must not let their brilliance be overshadowed by my shortcomings. Therefore, the simple thatched cottage and humble bed do not hinder my thoughts and feelings. Moreover, the morning breeze, evening moon, and courtyard flowers make my writing more inspired. Although I am uneducated, why can't I use simple language to express myself? It can also illuminate the inner chambers and relieve the boredom of the time, awakening the minds of others. Isn't it appropriate?' Therefore, it is called 'Jia Yucun'. The use of words like 'dream' and 'illusion' in the middle of the text is the essence of this book, and it also serves as a reminder to the readers.\",\n  \"annotations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft1\",\n      \"text\": \"The author uses the pseudonym 'Jia Baoyu' to represent himself in the book.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft2\",\n      \"text\": \"The author reflects on his own lack of achievements and compares himself unfavorably to the women he has known.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft3\",\n      \"text\": \"The author expresses his desire to write a book to express his gratitude and to highlight the accomplishments of the women in his life.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft4\",\n      \"text\": \"The author emphasizes that his humble living conditions do not hinder his thoughts and feelings, and he finds inspiration in the beauty of nature.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft5\",\n      \"text\": \"The author justifies his use of simple language by stating that it can still convey his message effectively.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"@ft6\",\n      \"text\": \"The author uses the words 'dream' and 'illusion' to convey the main theme of the book and to remind the readers of its significance.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
