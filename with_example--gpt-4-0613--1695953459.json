The author himself says: After experiencing a series of dreams, he hides the truth and uses spiritual communication to write this book, 'The Story of the Stone'[@ft1], hence the name 'Zhen Shi Yin'[@ft2]. But what and who does the book record? He also says: 'Now I am caught in the mundane world, achieving nothing. I suddenly think of all the women I have known: each one, upon careful reflection, surpasses me in conduct and wisdom. I, a grown man, am truly inferior to them, the women. I am filled with shame, but regret is of no use, it is a day of utter despair. On this day, I want to confess to the world my sins of squandering the blessings of heaven and my ancestors, the days of silk clothes and gourmet food, betraying the kindness of my father and brothers, and the virtues of my teachers and friends, leading to my current state of having no skills and a life in ruins. I compile this collection to tell the world; I know my sins are many, but there are many women in the boudoir who should not be forgotten because of my unworthiness. Therefore, the humble house and the rope bed, the tile stove, do not hinder my aspirations; moreover, the morning wind and the evening moon, the willows and the courtyard flowers, even more inspire my writing. Although I am uneducated and illiterate, why can't I use colloquial language to express it? It can also make the boudoir known. It can also break the boredom of the moment, awaken the eyes of others, isn't it appropriate?' Hence the name 'Jia Yu Cun'[@ft3]. Furthermore, the use of words like 'dream' and 'illusion' in the text is the main theme of this book, and also serves to remind the reader.\", \"annotations\": [{\"id\": \"@ft1\", \"text\": \"'The Story of the Stone' is another name for 'Dream of the Red Chamber', one of China's Four Great Classical Novels.
